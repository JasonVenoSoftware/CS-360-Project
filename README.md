# CS-360-Project

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This app was meant to offer the user an easy and convenient way to record their weight on a daily basis, and monitor their progress towards their weight loss goals.  This included requiring the user to sign in, record/modify data, and visualize it as they pleased.  

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There were three necessary screens in this project.  A Login screen where the user could input a username and password, a Display screen where they could both visualize and add data, and a Communicate screen where a question would appear, which asked if the user wanted to get SMS notifications.  

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
Like all my projects, I started by clearly outlining what the program had to do, and how I wanted it to do it.  Once I determined how many screens it needed, and what each screen did, it was simple to build each screen one at a time until a final program was achieved.  

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To test the code, I made it go through every possibility.  Though this is rarely possible, this program was simple enough where each permutation of user options is possible.  For example, there are only two options on the SMS question: yes or no.  It was trivial testing the outcome of each option.  

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The Login screen, while simple, showcased successful efficiency by giving the user a simple task, and a clear way to accomplish it.
